Without saying, the premise of the Mario franchise is a weird one: An Italian man [(presumably at age 25?)](https://www.polygon.com/23672468/super-mario-bros-movie-how-old-age) goes on an adventure to rescue a princess with his brother and collects mushrooms, magical flowers, and coins to make himself more powerful, to rescue said Princess from a giant, fire breathing turtle. In that description alone, the series is bound to spawn sequels that take the imaginations of players to new heights with each iterative installment. For a while, that was the case. But there was a shift in direction during the early to mid 2010s where each installment became increasingly stale with each iteration, but recent developments have shown that Mario can become weird and unexpected again.

With each installment within the early Mario series, each title looks drastically different that the previous. Whether this is due to technological limitations or just pure creativity, each installment in the Mario series brought something new and exciting to the table, without sacrificing its core identity. A great example of this is despite Super Mario Bros. 3 being a couple of years removed from Super Mario World, it had a completely different identity and design methodology with its art style and level design. Both games took different design approaches, but despite this, each game could stand on its own without surpassing the other. Super Mario World is more open with its map and branching level design, and offers allot more opportunities to find secrets in levels. Super Mario Bros 3 however had more focus on shorter, more obstacle focused levels. Your focus in Super Mario Bros 3 was to get to the goal as quickly as possible, but Super Mario World showed early on that if you poke your head around you might find a secret or two, which wasn't emphasized as much in Super Mario Bros 3. Each have their own power ups, game design and methodology, yet are equally classics that influenced generations of games to come. One can make this comparison with countless examples within the Mario Series before the 2010s and still find that each game uniquely stood apart where it can still hold up being its own standalone experience and not be superseded in quality by future entries. That kind of iterative approach, where each game in a series can be a unique experience worth playing on its own isn't as common these days, and it made the prospect of getting a new entry in the Mario series that much more compelling.

What was even a wilder concept, was making a new entry in the Mario franchise that was in a genre it usually wasn't in, where story was the priority. A remake of the 1996 title Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, was announced in 2023, which was able to not only succeed in making a highly regarded JRPG, but also contextualizing the Mushroom Kingdom. The latter point, is the most significant, as the Mushroom Kingdom served as the world where the series took place, but it only served to be a narrative device to take Mario from level to level. The gameplay took precedence, and the environments you went through stood as a backdrop to larger goal: Finish each level so you can rescue the princess. Even then, the levels that the player did explore served as obstacle courses for the player, and at first glance, you wouldn't think that a larger plot could occur here. There were no characters to interact with, or landmarks of interest that denizens of the Mushroom Kingdom gathered in. With that being said, how would you make a believable world in a context where the levels just serve as obstacle courses? But with collaboration with Square back in the 90s, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars was able to do this. The Mushroom Kingdom is an actual, explorable place with citizens, towns, and people to talk to. As a player, you were able to not only explore Bowser's Castle, but Peach's castle and Mario's home as well. In addition, getting to see the various neighboring towns and locales was a delight as each one was unique from the previous, and it felt way more lived in than we usually got to see in the previous installments. It also helped that the game did not itself too seriously, so there were goofy and memorable characters all throughout the game.

Gameplay-wise, it also was complementary to the platforming games, as the turn-based battles had the action commands, which let players used timed button presses to either guard or have a stronger attack. This ended up working in its favor as the action commands were sort of like how players would have to weave through levels on the dime, where timing was key with how you maneuvered across levels. The success of this game spawned 2 other series, Paper Mario and the Mario and Luigi series, which both take basic ideas of these games, the goofy story, timed action commands and humorous dialog and each giving their own spin on things. These games are beloved by fans, because they expand on the series, but give a different take on Mushroom Kingdom and neighboring locals, with goofy premises and beloved characters.

This trend continued, where the Mario RPGs and the main entries were allowed to take on weird and interesting premises and were given the freedom to experiment with new ideas all the way up to the late 2000s. One game in particular, arguably started the trend of homogenous Mario games: New Super Mario Bros. on the Nintendo DS. New Super Mario Bros DS sought to take the series to its classic roots, since there wasn't a new 2D installment in almost 20 years. The game itself was excellent, and I think was a great return to form, especially considering the Nintendo DS was allot more powerful than the Game Boy Advance, so seeing the 2D games in a fresh new 3D look with the reused 3D models from Super Mario 64 DS was a great technological showcase of what the Nintendo DS could do. However, this unfortunately started the trend of making a more homogenized Mario Series.

Soon after New Super Mario Bros DS, New Super Mario Bros Wii released, with it taking many ques from its older DS predecessor. This game introduces 4 player multiplayer to the 2D games, but aesthetically, the game felt way too similar to its prequel. The game wasn't bad in of itself, but seeing the same grasslands, desert, snow, forest, mountain world, and final lava world without any real aesthetic differences made the games feel boring in comparison to the older sequels. To make matters worse, it borrowed allot of the same music as well, which made the game musically and visually homogenous to other games in the series. This trend continued, with New Super Mario Bros 2, and New Super Mario Bros. U both reusing the same level themes and mechanics, without introducing anything ground breaking from the level design and gameplay. What made this even worse is that this trend ultimately seeped itself into the 3D games, with Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World taking a much tamer approach on its level themes and gimmicks. The level design of all the games mentioned was still good, and the core mechanics were refined and carried over from the classic games, but aesthetically and mechanically, there wasn't anything really "new" about how these games, looked, controlled and played. As a player, you knew what you were getting into, and there weren't as many surprises as there used to be in terms of aesthetics, level mechanics and locales because they were rehashed from previous games. This reuse of its themes and backdrops even brought its way to the spin off series, such as Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi and it was fairly clear that Mario was not allowed to be weird again.

This constant rehashing of the Mario series ultimately came to a halt, as a result of a couple of major events. First and foremost, the Super Mario Bros animated movie released in April 2023, which that in of itself was unprecedented due to the failure of the live action movie that came out in the 90s. That movie alone made Nintendo avoid the big screen for most of its IPs for a very long time. And it turns out, the movie was actually good! It became one of the highest grossing animated movies of all time, and was critically acclaimed and well received by audiences. Mario games don't usually have a focus on their plot so to have the movie not only be well received, but also be able to deliver memorable performances by its cast. Anya Taylor-Joy did an excellent job with her portrayal of Peach as a capable, stoic Princess was a big departure from Peach's interpretation in the games. Jack Black as Bowser captured both the goofiness that Bowser usually brings in the spin off series that isn't typically seen in the mainline games. Charlie Day was a great casting of Luigi, and he did a great job emphasizing the cowardice and goofiness that Luigi typically brings. While I don't think that casting Chris Pratt as Mario was the best move, regardless, I still think he did an ok job that still fit the character. You won't be finding a plot that's complicated or emotionally moving, but it didn't need to be, as this was still a great animated movie. The film was filled with references both sonically and visually from past Mario Games and Nintendo games, and finding each one was a delight. It doesn't hurt that this was Illumination most visually impressive films. All the environments were created with care and regard to the source material, and I think that respect for the original games made this an enjoyable movie to watch for old and new fans alike. The fact that this film was a success at all was an anomaly, and just went to show that Nintendo was willing to take risks with their IPs, which they haven't done in a very long time.

Furthermore, in the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, the Super Mario Bros Wonder game was revealed. If remakes, and the Super Mario Maker games don't count, this was the first new 2D Mario game in almost 11 years, so there was allot to measure up to. Additionally, what made things harder on the team was that Super Mario Maker has allowed players to create their own Mario levels, and If Nintendo has given the fans the ability to create any Mario level that they wanted, how were they going to create a game that would be worthwhile to audiences? Takashi Tezuka, who has been involved in the Mario Series for almost 40 years, tasked the team with a nearly impossible challenge: to create a Mario game full of hidden surprises and wonders.

Over 2000 ideas were come up with while the game was in development, and particular detail was put into making sure that the game stood out from previous 2D titles. One way that the development team did this, is that inspiration was taken from the 3D Mario games, where the player had agency on how they wanted to play the game. What games like Mario Odyssey and Mario 64 did is that instead of having a linear progression, where you have to beat a certain set of levels in a particular order, it's more like filling out a task list. For example, in Super Mario 64, the player needs to get 70 stars to fight the final battle but the order in which stars to get is open. The player decided the order and how hard or easy they wanted to make their playing experience the game based off the level they chose to play. Plus, there were 120 stars, so players could move on to another level if they go stuck, so that 70 Star completion goal can be achieved without playing every single level, which incentivize players to see the credits through if they got stuck. Super Mario Bros Wonder took inspiration with its approach to completion requirements for unlocking courses, with key items called Wonder Seeds. The player needed a certain number of Wonder seeds to unlock the castle level to beat the world in the game, but each level contained multiple Wonder Seeds. Often times, players might not get all the Wonder Seeds in 1 run, and so this lowered the bar and made the game accessible for players to see the credits through. There were also open areas, where you can pick which level you can do in any order, which also further gave player choice. One other way that the game let players choose how they wanted to play is the Badge system. The badge system allows play to equip badges that augment Mario's abilities, such as giving Mario a longer jump, a Piranha Plant grappling hook, or making Mario invisible. Giving the option for the player to switch up core abilities like this further more allows for expressiveness from the player's end by letting them choose how they want to play, which is unprecedented for 2D Mario, which didn't give players as much freedom in how they wanted to play.

The way they were able to pull off each level having their own win condition was through Wonder Flowers. Each level had its own Wonder Flower, which would change the stage when interacting with it. These wonders were unpredictable, and sometimes, would augment the level, or transforming the player, drastically changing the way the level was played. My favorite one in the game was in the second level, where all the Piranha Plants would break out into song and a march, with a memorable music number to boot. If this feature was only added to a handful of levels, it would be impressive, but it was added to EVERY single level in the game. That level of attention is unseen in the modern AAA game industry, and it was because the development team was given enough time and budget to delight and surprise players.

This wasn't aesthetically like the New Super Mario Bros Series. In fact, the game didn't borrow at all aesthetically from previous modern 2D Mario games, and looked allot more similar to the 2D art that was common back in the 90's and early 2000's. Mario was allot more expressive and animated than previous titles and that was thanks to both the hardware improvements that the Switch brought, and also the extra time that was taken to make this game allot more polished. The movie actually indirectly influenced the [additional expressiveness that Super Mario Bros. Wonder brought to the table](https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-11-super-mario-bros-wonder-part-2/), since they knew that development of the movie was going on, and they wanted to introduce something that would still delight players. The team was given ample time and budget to make sure that the game was given the right attention to detail and care it deserved, and it showed. Little details, such as a unique animation when a character goes down a pipe, or when a Goomba bites you when colliding with one, or how each character has unique jump sounds, makes playing the game a delight. All of this accumulated into a wonderful experience that I could not put down.

The final aspect of 2023 that made me more confident that Nintendo was willing to get back to Mario's more weirder roots was in the September 2023 Nintendo Direct. As the direct closed, the final announcement revealed that Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door was getting a remake the following year in 2024. This announcement was unprecedented, as based off the direction of the series, it seemed like each subsequent Paper Mario game was moving away from the gameplay design that TTYD and Paper Mario 64 set out to establish. As time went on, each game got more and more generic with its character designs, reducing the vast cast of characters to just a handful of multicolored Toads and a complete lack of original characters. In addition, its RPG roots were slowly stripped away as Partner Characters, the Badge system that Paper Mario 64 introduced did not appeared subsequent sequels as well. Not only did the game show that it was going to retain all of the original characteristics, it also remade the music and graphics in a faithful manner to original, which were so delight to finally see in HD. Hearing the original battle theme, and so many other tracks in the big band style that Mario is typically known for made the experience even more immersive than the original. All of the original mechanics that made the original Paper Mario so great were carried over and improved with great quality of life updates.

This game was weird enough that it made fans unconfident that it was going to get a sequel or be remade in the same manner as it originally presented itself back in 2004. Instead of the usual green plains that most Mario games start off in, the majority of the game takes place within a rundown town filled with petty thieves and criminal called Rougeport. The main town square even features a NOOSE at its center, implying that public executions took place here. That is an INSANE premise for a family friendly Mario Game. In the opening scene where you first arrive at the square, you seen in the corner of the scene that the Pianta mob is shaking down one of the residents and later in the game find out that this Mob runs a casino on the west side of town. One of the very first characters you meet within the game explains that he "lost all his hopes and dreams". Mario ends up going to avenge the death of a Koopa Troopa's father, and ends up fighting the dragon that supposedly killed him. (By the way, the dragon's weakness is frog noises?). In the middle of the game, there is an anime-style tournament arc and you fight a giant hawk. If all that sounds too farfetched for a Mario game, you would be right, and but it oddly works. Mixing the goofy, go-lucky nature of Mario with a place that is rundown, shady and unpleasant actually works very, makes this adventure feel lighthearted without taking itself too seriously. The narrative is able to not take itself too seriously and puts the plumber in a new and distinct scenario in every chapter. I cannot recommend playing this game enough, and I truly hope that future Paper Mario games take notes of what made this game remembered so fondly to fans of the series for all these years.

The big worry for both of these Mario RPG remakes was that they would be sanitized of their weird charm to ensure that they are more aligned to the standard Mario brand. In the late 90's to the early 2000's, Mario spin offs didn't necessarily comply with standard Mario brand guidelines. Because there was a lack of guidance to how to structure character designs, motifs and environments, there was allot more creativity back then, which I think why Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door stood out to allot of people. Character designs were allowed to skew from the typical Toad and Goomba designs, and it's why allot of the characters and their personalities stuck in most players’ minds for many years. So, for a remake like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga on 3DS, allot of the characters were redesigned to make them more in line to the modern Mario designs. While the characters were more in model to the standard Mario designs, allot of the charm was removed from that off brand, more cartoony look to the Mario enemies in the original game, which left many original players disappointed in these remakes. Surprisingly, the original charm was protected, and all the original character designs were retained in the remakes of these two beloved Mario RPGs. This was a bold step, and with allot of the major Quality of Life features added to the remakes, these games surpass the originals and introduce many new players to these classic titles that are a bit quirkier than typical Mario titles.

All in all, I think we are entering an era of Mario where the character and games is allowed to be more goofy, more expressive and take more risks. Mario in my eyes is at its best when it redefines and refines whatever genre it enters, and I believe that the future is weird and bright for our mustachioed plumber.
