The Legend of Zelda's reputation is one that cannot be understated. What it has done for gaming landscape has impacted so 
many games and still continues to innovate to this day. However, one area that it has fallen short on, much like many Nintendo
sereis is the way it has approached storytelling. They are fairly basic most of the time, ussusally saving the damsel in distres or fighting whatever villan has taken over the land that week. In Nintendo's perspective, gameplay takes precedent over story, and they prefer that the player creates stories themselves from the suprises that they see through their time in the game. However,
I believe if Nintendo takes a look to it's past games and the series namesake, they can find a different and much more 
engaging approach to story telling while still making sure that gameplay also retains a priority.
