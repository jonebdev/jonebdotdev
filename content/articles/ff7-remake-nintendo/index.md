![FFVII Remake](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1462040/header.jpg?t=1696383548)

Final Fantasy 7 Remake fascinates me in so many ways. Despite the first part only taking 1/3 of the source material of original, it was able to create a 40 hour game with that content alone with an engaging story and incredible & innovative gameplay. While I have my issues with the first part of the remake trilogy, after playing several hours of the second part Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I can confidently say that the game has addressed my concerns. It definitely justifies its existence, however while playing Rebirth, I got thinking: What games in Nintendo's catalog would constitute a remake a kin to Final Fantasy 7 or other Capcom titles like Resident Evil 2 Remake?

Nintendo is not shy to doing traditional remakes and remasters, as there are plenty you can find on the Switch right now. However, there are none that I can think of that really can be classified on a similar level like Final Fantasy VII Remake, where the core mechanics are changed, there is added gameplay and story content, with a visual overhaul to boot. I would like to go over some ideas of games that I think would benefit from this treatment, that could bring new life to their core content while also being able to stand side by side with the original source material.

## Ocarina of Time

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of the most important games of all time, and it's impact cannot be understated. This game has already been remade, with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D which is one of the best remakes of all time in my opinion, however this remake doesn't change any of the source material (In fact, it uses some of the original games' code!). Looking a bit deeper, the game had a tumultuous development, changing platforms midway through development from the failed Nintendo 64DD to the base Nintendo 64, with large amounts of cut content and gameplay concepts. There was even a planned expansion for the game, Ura Zelda, but that never came to pass.

After playing the remake myself, I think that there are things that Ocarina of Time does allot better than future titles, but also areas where it ages poorly, such as enemy design and combat. With the learnings from future titles such as Breath of the Wild, I think that revisiting this game could make for an interesting experience.

In addition to revisiting old scrapped concepts, I believe that the most captivating change to me would be changes to the story, and how moving to a modern console would enhance how it is told. Navi was always speaking on behalf of Link, but what if she actually spoke during gameplay, and didn't bring the game to a complete pause? I think that was what made players in the past despise her, but if Nintendo executes on it well, it could be engaging, as many other titles do this, including the previously mentioned Final Fantasy VII. In addition, one interesting change that could be made is expanding on Sheik's role within the story. There is key art from the final game of Sheik fighting along side Link, and exploring Sheik's character as added content while Link is off on his adventures would make the dreams come true of finally having a playable Zelda.... oh wait, spoilers!

Concepts of an Ocarina of Time modern remake have been floating around the internet for ages. There are many unreal engine fan remakes floating around remaking the game with modern visuals. I don't think it would be out of the ordinary for Nintendo to reimagine the game, and the fan demand is clearly there for it.

## Startropics

Startropics as a concept always fascinated me as the game has such a unique setting. Startropics was a 2D top down game, akin to the Legend of Zelda. The main character, Mike Jones (yes, that is his name) is exploring a far off island to visit his uncle and finds himself fighting using a yo-yo against aliens that have invaded the island. Released late in the Nintendo Entertainment System's lifetime only in the US and Europe, it garnered mixed reception. It even got a sequel four years later in 1994, but by the time it came out, interest had waned for the NES and we never saw a Startropics game since.

I don't have any nostalgia for this game, nor have I played too far into it, to be fair, but I think that this is a game worth revisiting and remaking. I think that the base game can be expanded upon into a really interesting story, and Nintendo doesn't have many action heavy story based game in their arsenal. If Nintendo has a powerful enough console in the next generation, I can see a game like this captivate people if it has good gameplay, graphics and an excellent story.

## Pokemon Generation 1

Pokemon has many remakes already, and I think that it might be fair to quickly dismiss my thoughts about this topic. Generation 1 has already been remade twice now, with FireRed and LeafGreen releasing in 2004, and Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee releasing in 2018. However, I think one thing that would make a FFVII style remake of these games stand apart is if the completely revamp the turn based combat of the original. It is fair to say that the gameplay of most Pokemon games is fairly similar, and that large changes to the model that was brought up all those years ago hasn't really occurred, outside Pokemon Legends Arceus. What made FFVII remake so captivating is that it ditched the turn based combat, but was able to retain the core of what made the FFVII gameplay so special all those years ago with the materia system and limits, while also introducing new gameplay concepts.

I think Generation 1 is a perfect candidate to start changing up the formula. Generation 1 has a limited cast compared to future titles, and one thing that hurts Pokemon games is scope creep. There are so many character to program, so many interactions to consider, and so many gameplay elements that have been introduced throughout the years that it's fair to see some of these not carry over into future games. Limiting the scope to Generation 1 and maybe a handful of other Pokemon from future generations can ensure that proper care and attention goes into the gameplay and animations of each Pokemon. In addition, with new gameplay, Pokemon that were typically ignored in previous generations could be brought into new light in an different gameplay style. For example, a Pokemon like Rapidash might not be considered that good to use in gen 1, but in this game, if Gamefreak decides to change the turn based gameplay into something more dynamic, Pokemon that have been traditionally forgotten can be used in a new light, without having to introduce a new form or generational gimmick. The map can be expanded and modified, since we aren't bound by the limitations of the retro consoles, and we can explore Kanto in a brand new light, thus making the game less of a slog for returning players. One way Gamefreak can do this is adding overworld Pokemon interactions similar to Legends Arceus, where Pokemon interact in the overworld with other pokemon and the players movements.

Additionally, with revisiting Gen 1, comes the opportunity to explore concepts from the original story that weren't touched on in the Game Boy original, and can expand on concepts introduced in later titles. I think having the ability to go to the Johto Gyms three years before the events of Gold, Silver and Crystal would be a fan favorite addition. In addition, imagine if players could explore the motives behind Red staying behind in Mount Silver, or expanding on Team Rocket's motivations, or if the game went deeper into the lore on Mew and Mewtwo. There is huge potential on revisiting these games, but if they do it right, this can easily end up being a fan favorite title in the Pokemon Series.

## Ice Climbers

![Ice Climbers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/NES_Ice_Climber.png)

Ice Climbers was an early NES title that had the player going up a mountain, aiming for a high score. The two characters, Nana and Popo are already iconic mainstays in Super Smash Bros., but they have not had a new game since their NES debut. There are obviously a ton of 2D sidescrollers across Nintendo's library but they have mostly been vertically focused with aim to go from left to right, to the goal. You can see this fundamentally with all sorts of sidescrollers, not just throughout Nintendo titles. However, Nintendo has a interesting opportunity here as the Ice Climber's main goal is to climb an ice mountain as far as they possibly can. I think having a unique take on the 2D Platformer genre, where vertical movement is the main goal could pose for a really interesting  gameplay loop. The Ice Climbers can use their unique abilities and tools such as their hoists (as seen in their Up-B move in Smash). Another unique opportunity posed by revisiting the Ice Climbers is one player controlling 2 characters, as seen in Smash. I am sure that Nintendo can come up with interesting gameplay concepts for this and still retain the familiarity from Smash Brothers.

## Conclusion

What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion with me on what I thought were good candidates for a FFVII style remake within Nintendo's library.
