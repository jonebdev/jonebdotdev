# joneb.dev

This is the source code for joneb.dev. It was made using Portfolio Minimal, a Gatsby Theme that that is designed for portfolio websites. In addition, my resume is stored here, and it is written using LaTeX. I also maintain a blog here that I write to from time to time about things that I am passionate about, such as Video Games, TV Shows and Films.
